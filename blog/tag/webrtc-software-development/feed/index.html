<h4>What is WebRTC?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2011, Google created an open-source solution. A WebRTC solution that provides real-time communication (RTC) via application programming interfaces to web browsers and mobile applications (APIs).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The method of enabling real-time communication on the web is called WebRTC. In simple words, a server allows making communication between two browsers to complete a meeting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebRTC (Web real-time communication) is an open-source project where communication can peer from one place to another place through web browsers and mobile applications. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebRTC technology provides various features including audio/Video calling, chat, and file-sharing options in real time. It is more convenient to open on a desktop or mobile device by using any modern browser like Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog will cover WebRTC&#8217;s functionality as well as its advantages, drawbacks, and business use cases. </span></p>
<h4>We will discuss the following list of topics:</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does WebRTC work? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is WebRTC Secure?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantage of WebRTC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason to Choose WebRTC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Industry can use and take benefit of WebRTC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of WebRTC for Business</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>How does WebRTC work?</h4>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WebRTC uses &#8220;P2P&#8221; (Peer-to-peer)  technology to transport data directly between browsers.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can transmit real-time data, audio, or video.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For browsers to communicate with one another, NAT ( Network Address Translation ) traversal methods are required.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> P2P (Peer-to-Peer) communication must go through a gateway server.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The three primary APIs used for WebRTC:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Media Stream:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It gathers audio and video by using the camera and microphone on you&#8217;re device.</span></li>
<li><b>Peer Connection:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Both audio and video are transmitted. Enables audio and peer-to-peer video communication. this includes opening the connection, keeping an eye on it, and turning it off.</span></li>
<li><b>Data Channel:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It transmits any kind of data that allows it to be sent between peers in both directions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing and sending audio, video, and data to other browsers or websites is made possible by these APIs.</span></p>
<h4>Is WebRTC Secure?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebRTC is the most secure audio and video calling technology currently in the market. All small, medium and large companies use the WebRTC platform to deliver their communication easily and securely.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.capanicus.com/webrtc-application-development.php"><b>WebRTC Service provider Company</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adds that level of security at the time of developing the application. This ensures that WebRTC is the best technology option for you&#8217;re present and future business goals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the most popular programs are web browsers, which have advanced security and privacy capabilities. These characteristics support web application isolation, protect sensitive user data like credit card numbers, and project browser hacking for attack initiation.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">When creating a WebRTC application, capanicus keep the following things in mind to make it secure:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Encryption of Media </b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information must be encrypted with SRTP ( Secure Real Time Protocol) before being sent between two WebRTC peers so that no one may decode the message without the correct encryption keys.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Secure Encryption Key Exchange </b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The encryption channel must be set up securely according to WebRTC specifications to make it challenging to capture the encryption keys. The signals channel may be used by several key exchange protocols to send data. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third party could decode the information if the signal channel is hacked. Specific channels are utilized where keys are directly exchanged between peers to eliminate this risk.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Using Secure Signals</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the data in that countless form a secure connection is necessary between the peer client and the web server that manages signals. this makes it more challenging for a criminal to take control of the session.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>HTTPS ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of a browser window to operate WebRTC helps its security. The most popular programs today are web browsers, which have advanced security and privacy capabilities. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To access WebRTC functionalities, HTTPS must be used. Using the HTTPS protocol, which is now used by most websites, encrypts a single signal.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Rights of access to the media</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before accessing a camera, microphone, or screen-sharing video, users can actively allow authorization to individual sites.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Use of visual indicators</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re camera, microphone, and screen sharing are in use, real signs will be visible at the time of the meeting.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Device data list</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the user does not provide the right information on the site, the device information will be hidden.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Protection from IP Leaking</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy and tracking concerns are reduced by giving IP address restrictions and alternatives.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Systems for mobile devices</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major mobile operating systems like Android and iOS adopt safeguards, additional security, and privacy which can be checked through their app store submission procedures, even when not used by an embedded browser.</span></p>
<h4>Advantages of WebRTC</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>WebRTC applications</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide a lot of advantages to the user, integrator, and developer. In previous times this type of technology and collaboration was less in the past.</span></p>

<h4>5 ways your business can take advantage of WebRTC</h4>
<h4>Easy To integrate and deploy:</h4>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">Before WebRTC for audio and video communication people have to rely on Skype for their communication or they have to set up a full hardware-based Unified system that needs plenty of money. WebRTC allows us to integrate audio and video directly from applications or websites. The main advantage of WebRTC doesn’t need any special app or service, so it can be implemented within your system with the current code. It has an open source so can be modified as per Business needs.</p>
<h4>Improvement in Customer Relationships:</h4>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">WebRTC can help you improve your customer relationship and experience by connecting customers with employees of your company to get instant support. WebRTC doesn’t need any kind of downloads, it is just a platform that can easily be integrated and ready to use for smooth and hassle-free audio and video calling. WebRTC allows us to connect with our customers from sales to process to support thus increasing the customer experience from all around the World. WebRTC helps your sales team to increase their sales and the rest of the process.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: Justify;">Real-time Collaboration:</h4>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">A text-based solution like chats and Email can never be a good replacement for face-to-face communication. WebRTC filled this void with clean audio and video calling. It isn’t just about connecting with customers or clients, anyone can connect with each other in real time with amazing audio and video quality. A colleague who is from a different part or isn’t able to come to the office can easily collaborate with their teams. It can help your employees to be more engaged with their colleagues by making communication and sharing in real-time.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: Justify;">Secure Your Communication with WebRTC:</h4>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">Communication security is the main concern for any company. It is important for all companies to have a secure communication network as communication is where you share all details about projects and companies. Most communication systems rely on outside data centers but WebRTC allows you to integrate it within your software. For example, most VOIP solutions still use a less secure version of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to facilitate calls, while WebRTC application uses the secure version of this protocol (SRTP) in their code. Every company or customer wants to have secure communication about their company and they don’t want to rely on an outsider for their company security.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: Justify;">Cost-effective and efficient:</h4>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">WebRTC solution helps you save plenty of money by spending less on the communication system. VoIP or UC cost tons of money in development and installation. WebRTC has implemented SRTP from the start as a standard to ensure the integrity of the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">About efficiency, it helps your employee to communicate and share in real-time thus making everyone available for each other. All the problems can be solved in real-time with hassle-free communication.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: Justify;">Conclusion:</h4>
<p style="text-align: Justify;">This is the new hot innovation in communication and every company and business owner is switching to WebRTC for real-time hassle-free secure communication. WebRTC software development Company can implement this in your system in no time. You should consider choosing this communication system for your Business and have a talk with the <a href="https://www.capanicus.com/webrtc-application-development.php">WebRTC application development company</a>.
