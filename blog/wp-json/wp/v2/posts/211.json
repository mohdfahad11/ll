WebRTC allows us to integrate audio and video directly from applications or websites.

WebRTC helps your sales team to increase their sales and the rest of the process.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: Justify;\">Real-time Collaboration:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: Justify;\">A text-based solution like chats and Email can never be a good replacement for face-to-face communication. WebRTC filled this void with clean audio and video calling. It isn\u2019t just about connecting with customers or clients, anyone can connect with each other in real time with amazing audio and video quality. A colleague who is from a different part or isn\u2019t able to come to the office can easily collaborate with their teams.

It is important for all companies to have a secure communication network as communication is where you share all details about projects and companies. Most communication systems rely on outside data centers but WebRTC allows you to integrate it within your software. For example, most VOIP solutions still use a less secure version of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to facilitate calls, while WebRTC application uses the secure version of this protocol (SRTP) in their code. Every company or customer wants to have secure communication about their company and they don\u2019t want to rely on an outsider for their company security.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: Justify;\">Cost-effective and efficient:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: Justify;\">WebRTC solution helps you save plenty of money by spending less on the communication system. VoIP or UC cost tons of money in development and installation. WebRTC has implemented SRTP from the start as a standard to ensure the integrity of the system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: Justify;\">About efficiency, it helps your employee to communicate and share in real-time thus making everyone available for each other. All the problems can be solved in real-time with hassle-free communication.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: Justify;\">Conclusion:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: Justify;\">This is the new hot innovation in communication and every company and business owner is switching to WebRTC for real-time hassle-free secure communication.
