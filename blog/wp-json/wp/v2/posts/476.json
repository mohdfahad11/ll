Here are some technologies that can change the market soon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Machine Learning<\/strong>&#8211; It is a subset of Artificial intelligence. Machine learning can be used to train computer programs to carry tasks on their own, either by feeding them the initial data set or by learning on their own from the outcomes. Machine learning is that part of science that needs no human intervention when developed fully. Machine Learning is rapidly being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. Machine Learning jobs include engineers, developers, researchers, and data scientists.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Edge Computing<\/strong>&#8211; Formerly a technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud dominating the market. As the quantity of data we\u2019re dealing with continues to increase, we\u2019ve realized the shortcomings of cloud computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data centre for processing. The exclusive demands of computing, storing, and networking for each use case will drive the development of custom form factors right from the level of the processor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Artificial Intelligence<\/strong>&#8211; AI has picked up a lot of buzz in the market for some time now and it will continue to be a trend to watch in 2020 and beyond. dis is coz it has started to affect how we live, work, and play. AI refers to computer systems built to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such as recognition of images, speech or patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster and more accurately than humans.<\/p>\n<p>Features of AI:- 1. Facial recognition<br \/>\n2. Cloud Computing<br \/>\n3. Deep Learning<br \/>\n4. Chatbots<br \/>\n5. Cloud Computing<br \/>\n6. Data Ingestion<br \/>\n7. Automate Tasks<br \/>\n8. Quantum Computing<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Blockchain<\/strong>&#8211; It\u2019s a decentralized digital ledger that stores transactions on thousands of computers around the globe. dis helps in creating a record of transactions that cannot be altered. Each of these records is time-stamped and linked to the previous one. It is secure coz of its encrypted and decentralized nature. Blockchain finds its application mainly in cryptocurrencies. But, it is not limited to dis single domain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cloud Computing<\/strong>&#8211; Cloud Computing is nothing but storing and accessing data over the internet instead of your computer&#8217;s hard drive. For example:- all the movies and series available on Amazon Prime or Netflix are stored on their cloud platform. There is no doubt that cloud computing has emerged as the best skill to learn in the 21st century.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As technology evolves, it enables even faster change and progress,<span class=\"more-button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/upcoming-technologies-that-will-trigger-your-carrier\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">UPCOMING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL TRIGGER YOUR CARRIER<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":477,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[28],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=476"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":569,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476\/revisions\/569"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/477"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=476"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=476"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.capanicus.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=476"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
